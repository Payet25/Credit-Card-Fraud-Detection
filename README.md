The main highlights include:

Dataset: The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 classified as fraud.
Techniques:
- Data preprocessing, including handling duplicates
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns in the data.
- Feature selection to enhance model performance.
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision and ROC-AUC to measure model effectiveness on the imbalanced dataset.
Results: Demonstrates high-performance fraud detection while addressing the class imbalance problem.
